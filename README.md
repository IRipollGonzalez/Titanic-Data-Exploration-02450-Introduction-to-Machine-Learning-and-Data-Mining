# Titanic-Data-Exploration-02450

Exploratory data analysis of the Titanic dataset for the DTU course **02450 – Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining**.  
The project applies feature extraction, visualization techniques, and principal component analysis (PCA) to understand the dataset and assess the feasibility of future machine learning tasks such as classification and regression.  
All analysis is performed in Python.

## Project Context

**Course:** 02450 – Introduction to Machine Learning and Data Mining  
**Institution:** Technical University of Denmark (DTU)  
**Academic Period:** 2024  
**Deliverables:** Report (PDF) + Source code  

This project analyzes the well-known Titanic dataset, which contains demographic, socio-economic, and travel-related information about passengers aboard the RMS Titanic. The purpose is to examine the dataset in depth, identify patterns, clean and preprocess attributes, and visualize structure in the data before applying machine learning methods in later reports.

The dataset used in this project is **titanic.csv**, obtained from Kaggle.

## Goals of the Project

The project follows the structure and requirements of Report 1:

### **1. Dataset Description**
- Historical and contextual overview  
- Source reference  
- Summary of prior analyses from literature and Kaggle benchmarks  
- Identification of meaningful prediction targets for future ML reports

### **2. Attribute Analysis**
- Variable types (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)  
- Discrete vs continuous attributes  
- Data quality issues (missing values, inconsistent formatting, outliers)  
- Summary statistics for numerical attributes  

### **3. Visualizations & PCA**
- Boxplots for outlier inspection  
- Histograms to assess distribution shapes  
- Correlation matrix and heatmap  
- PCA:  
  - Explained variance plot  
  - Principal directions  
  - Projection onto first 2–3 components  

### **4. Discussion**
- Summary of insights obtained from the data  
- Evaluation of whether future ML tasks (classification & regression) are feasible  
- Considerations for preprocessing before modeling
